# Intermittent Blank FlatList in React Native

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in React Native where a FlatList component intermittently renders as blank, even when data fetching is successful. The issue is particularly challenging to debug due to its inconsistent nature.

## Bug Description

A FlatList component is used to display data fetched from an API. While the API call is successful and returns data, the FlatList often remains empty.  This behavior is not consistent and does not follow any apparent pattern.

## Solution

The solution involves a more robust error handling and data validation process.  In addition, adding a `ListEmptyComponent` helps in better user experience.
